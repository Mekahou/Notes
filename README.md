# Computational Economics Notes

These are my current idiosyncratic notes on computational economics and modern machine learning methods.

## Goal

To eventually turn them into a graduate-level course on ML and Computational Economics.

## Notes on Deep Learning:
1) Learning non-smooth functions, specifically functions with kink. Application: McCall Search Model, [code](https://github.com/Mekahou/Notes/blob/main/deep_learning/McCall_DL.ipynb)
