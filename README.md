# Computational Economics Notes

These are my current, idiosyncratic notes on computational economics and modern machine learning methods.

## Goal

To eventually turn them into a graduate-level course on ML and computational economics.

## Notes on Deep Learning

1. **Learning non-smooth functions**, specifically functions with kinks.  
   **Application:** McCall Search Model  
   **Code and notes:** [McCall](https://github.com/Mekahou/Notes/blob/main/deep_learning/McCall_DL.ipynb)

2. **Derivative of a neural network with respect to the input**  
**Application:** Solving a simple ordinary differential equation  
**Code and notes:** [Derivative w.r.t. input: ODE](https://github.com/Mekahou/Notes/blob/main/deep_learning/derivative_wrt_input.ipynb)
